In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create 3D shapes starting with 2D sketches. We’ll cover essential operations like extrusion and revolving to transform your sketches into complex 3D models. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to enhance your skills, this guide will help you unlock the potential of FreeCAD. Let’s get started!

## How to Set Up FreeCad:


## How to Create a Sketch:

### Introduction to sketch making:

The way you create a body or a negative space needs to be based on a 2D sketch which can be created at different axes. To create a new project you need to first click on new, then on Create body. After that, you can click on “Create Sketch”. Then a canvas with the 2 2D axis and a center point will appear.
